# Digitising small objects

The various tips and tricks learned in the previous sessions can not only be applied to human-and-larger-scale objects, but also to objects only centimetres tall.
In fact, smaller objects such as rocks make for a great way of learning SfM-photogrammetry.

A good example of a digitised handsized sample is Malte's mineral below, which has been digitised to scale through use of ground control points.

Sadly, SketchFab does not (yet?) have distance querying built-in to the frontend.
However, SketchFab Labs does provide such a feature.
Access it [here](https://labs.sketchfab.com/experiments/measurements/) and search for *Rock sample Malte* to load the model above and measure the sample's dimensions.

:class: seealso

Verification of your data is key to whatever you do in life.
As such, why not ask Malte for the original rock sample and compare digital vs real dimensions?
