# Exercise 2 - learning the ropes of GCP and marker detection

```{admonition} Deadline
Please complete this exercise **by the end of the current session**.
```

## Learning goals

**After this session you will be able to:**

- Generate your own set of GCPs;
- Manually detect GCPs in a set of images; and,
- Automatically detect GCPs using computer algorithms.

Please note that **we only provide feedback and support for students enrolled in the course at the University Centre of Svalbard**.
```

We now focus on familiarising ourselves with the concept of GCPs and markers.
This includes the generation of both Metashape markers and open-source ArUco markers, as well as their manual and automated detection.

## Assignment

Proceed to the [GCP tutorial](../l2/markers "GCP tutorial") while keeping the following assignments in mind:

```{admonition} Checklist and questions
:class: note
- [ ] GCP generation
  - [ ] Generate a single Metashape marker and print it on A4
  - [ ] Generate a single ArUco marker and print it on A4
- [ ] photoshoot:
  - [ ] Place both markers near an object of interest (e.g., computer screen, chair)
  - [ ] Take at least 10 photos of the target from different angles and distances, making sure the markers are fully included in at least 3 photos each
- [ ] GCP detection:
  - [ ] create a new Metashape project comforming the standardised project environment
  - [ ] detect the ArUco markers manually
  - [ ] detect the Metashape markers automatically
  - [ ] add real world coordinates to the GCPs
```

In addition, please come up with some thoughts on the following statements:

- GCP detection requires only part of the markers to be visible in an image
- A GCP should always be fully imaged in at least five images
