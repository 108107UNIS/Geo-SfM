# Welcome to Geo-SfM

The **Geo-SfM** course teaches you the basic concepts of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry using the Agisoft Metashape software suite alongside the Python programming language. No previous programming experience is required, though may come in handy for more advanced uses.

Geo-SfM covers the necessary skills needed to conduct SfM photogrammetry in a scientifically sound manner, targeting specifically the geosciences.

```{admonition} Open access
This course is **open for everyone to follow online**. The aim of the course is to share processing practices amongst the geosciences and to facilitate more efficient and reproducible processing.

```{admonition} The University Centre in Svalbard
This Geo-SfM course is part of the [University Centre in Svalbard Arctic Geology 222 bachelor course](https://www.unis.no/course/ag-222-integrated-geological-methods-from-outcrop-to-geomodel/), running each spring.
```

## Course format and topics

This course is split in several modules, consisting of interactive lectures walkthroughs, and exercises. The exercises will focus on developing competence in SfM photogrammetr processing for geoscientific purposes, and in particular focusing on the use of Agisoft Metashape. Typical topics cover the operating of Agisoft Metashape, the use of ArUco markers and automated marker detection, and the use of automated Python scripting for automated processing.
Furthermore, optimal image acquisition is discussed, as well as the use of SfM for different use cases.

## Motivation for the course

The main part of the first half of the course is to learn how to use the Agisoft Metashape software suite.
However, in addition we also try to address the following and help you to learn a number of other skills related to open and reproducible science.
These include:
- Keeping a log of every decision and change you make
- Standardising your approach to ensure your science is reproducible
- Archiving raw data, metadata, processing reports
