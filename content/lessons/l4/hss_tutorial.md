```{admonition} Hardware and Software needed
:class: info

In this tutorial, we suggest using the following material.

## Photo acquisition with Lightbox Foldio360

### Photo set using your phone/tablet

Log in to the Foldio360 App on your phone and connect to your Foldio360 device by clicking on "Select device". It will automatically detect the Foldio device and connect to it.

```{admonition} Problems connecting to the lightbox
:class: tip

1. Make sure that the Foldio360 light box/Foldio360 Smart Dome is turned on
2. Turn on the bluetooth on your phone/tablet
3. Disconnect other devices connected to the Foldio360 device 
```

Now that your phone/tablet is linked with the Foldio360 light box, you can edit and adjust multiple parameters from the Foldio360 light box/Foldio360 Smart Dome for optimal photo acquisition.

Going from left to right on the Foldio360 App menu, you will find:

**Rotating speed**:
This parameter defines the rotating speed of the platform.
We suggest using 1x for better acquisition.

**Frame**:
This parameter defines the number of times that the platform will stop to take a picture. There are three different options: 24, 36 or 48.
The more stops you select, the more shots you will take from your sample.

**Center indicator**:
When selecting it, a light grid will appear inside the box for optimal positioning of your sample.
Make sure to deactivate it when starting the photo acquisition.

**Turn table**

**Brightness**

**Color temperature**

When starting the photo acquisition, the device will start rotating and the phone/camera will take as many pictures as the ones defined in the Frame menu.


### Photo set using a PC

#### Step 1. Connect to the Foldio360 device
Connect to the Foldio360 device using your phone/tablet.
After the Foldio360 device has been linked to your phone, click the four bars on the lower-right corner of your screen and select DSLR 360.

Press the four bars on the low-right corner to select Settings. Under settings > DSLR > select IR remote delay > define the IR remote delay to 4-5 seconds to assure that the photos are not taken while the table is rotating.

The rest of the settings are the same as the ones for the photo set for phone/tablet workflow.
```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

Make sure that the color temperature matches the White Balance settings in the Imaging Edge Desktop App.
This, however, is a few steps further.
```

#### Step 2. Connect the camera to the computer
Physically connect the camera to the computer and open the Imaging Edge Desktop App on your PC.
Turn on the camera. Double-click it on the Edge Remote App to link the camera to it. If it doesn't show, refresh the window.

After doing Steps 1 and 2, you will visualize the live camera image on your computer screen through the Imaging Edge Desktop App. Now, adjust and center the sample on the screen by changing the camera position and zooming.

Now, you have to adjust the settings for perfect photo acquisition. You do this using the Imaging Edge Desktop App.
Going from top to bottom in the Imaging Edge Desktop App menu, we recommend using the following settings:

**Shooting**:
Do not change

**Mode**:
Normal

**Main Settings**:
- Camera mode: keep it in Manual
- Shutter speed: Lower it as much as needed to adapt the light after defining the F and ISO values
- Focus (F): Keep it as high as possible (around 30 is a good value)
- ISO: Keep it as low as possible (50-200 is a good range)
- EV: Do not change
- Flash: Do not change

**Sub Settings**:
Make sure that the White Balance is the same as the Color Temperature defined in the Foldio360 App on your phone (5600 K is a good value).

**Focus**:
Try both Manual Focus (MF) and Auto Focus (AF). If no big changes, go with AF.

**Histogram**:
The color bars should be merged into one in the highest peak. You do this either manually adjusting the focus on your camera or clicking the arrows in the app.

**Save Settings**:
Click on the three dots and define the file path where you want to save the data.

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

We recommend starting your workflow by defining the file path where you want to save the data. Keeping a good data structure is essential. You will always know where your data is, it will help avoid mistakes and data loss.

To check that all the settings are optimal for photo acquisition, take a Connection Test by clicking on the camera icon in the "Shooting" menu, or in the phone/tablet menu.
By doing this, you will take a single shot. It will allow you to double-check that the picture is focused, the colors are correct, the file path is the desired one, etc.

If everything is correct, you can start with the photo acquisition.
